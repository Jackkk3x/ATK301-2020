	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>Welcome to my page. I hope all is well through this world pandemic.
	Through this time I've used it to focus on my passion for music.
	Instead of just focusing on instruments I started actually laying vocals on my tunes .
  The outcome came out better than I could've ever expected.  </p>
<section>
	<h2> Thanks</h2>
	<p>I would like to thank you for not only being my professor but a very great educator.
		I learned alot from this class that I can truly see myself using in the future.
