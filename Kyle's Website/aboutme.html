  <aside><p class="asidetext">I am a 20 year old soon to be Junior at Illinois State university. My sophmore year was cut short by the Corona virus, but students all around the world are experiencing the same situation. I am a Computer Systems Technology major and I should hopefully finish with a minor in business in under my 4-year period here at ISU. I am currently trying to keep up to date with school work at home and I hope for an amazing future.</aside>
